            <h1>What is Context API ?</h1>
            <p>Ans: The React-Context-API is a way for a React Application to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using redux.</p>
